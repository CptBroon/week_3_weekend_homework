# week_3_weekend_homework

This project is a short webpage that allows users to play Rock, Paper, Sicssors against eachother.
The project has been created in order to practice working with the concept of controllers and routes.
It also allowed me to consolidate my learning in relation to HTML and CSS from the last week.
